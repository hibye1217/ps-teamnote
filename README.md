# TeamNote
My version of the teamnote. Use at your own risk, because god this code is terrible

## Notation
- To Learn (Purple): I need to learn this later.
- To Add (Red): I learned this, but I didn't added this yet.
- To Test (Orange): I did put some codes on here, but use at your own risk.
- To Revise (Brown): This code does work, but the style might not match my current one.
- Completed (Green): You can freely use this code.

Anything that are written in gray texts are untested statements i.e. might be false.
